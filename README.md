# Flashbang Preventer

Flashbang Preventer is a Python application designed to reduce the impact of sudden bright areas on your screen by overlaying a semi-transparent shader on those regions. It continuously monitors the screen for bright areas and dynamically applies shading to prevent discomfort.
